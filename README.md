# 💼 William Melton – Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio site, built using only HTML and CSS as part of my full stack learning journey. It serves as a digital introduction to my work, skills, and ongoing growth as a developer.

## 🧠 Purpose

This project is the first step in a curated series of progressively complex portfolio builds. The current focus is on mastering layout, responsiveness, and visual styling using semantic HTML and clean CSS.

Future iterations will introduce interactivity, JavaScript, and full stack features as my experience expands.
